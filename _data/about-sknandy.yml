  Prof. S. K. Nandy was instrumental in initiating research in LSI System Design at the Indian Institute of Science. He worked towards setting up a State-of-the-art laboratory for Computer Aided Design at the institute in 1983 with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme and the Government of India. This laboratory has active collaborations with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA, Technical University of Delft, The Netherlands, Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, The Netherlands, Tokyo University and Waseda University, Japan, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, and RWTH Aachen University, Germany. Today, the laboratory is engaged in state-of-the-art research in Embedded Reconfigurable System on Chip architectures for next-generation high-performance computing on the edge and core.
  
  Prof. Nandy is a Senior Professor in the Department of Computational and Data Sciences. Over the years, he has graduated 28 PhDs, 16 MSc.(Engg.) and over 100 Masterâ€™s students who have worked for their theses in the laboratory. He has another 8 PhDs in progress. His current research addresses important issues in micro-architectural and compiler optimizations for power and performance in Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs) and Runtime Reconfigurable System on Chips (MP-SoCs). All of his research target massively parallel architectures/platforms for accelerating computations for Next Generation Sequence Alignment, Numerical Linear Algebra, Real-time Face Recognition, Cognition Engines, and Molecular Dynamics. Prof. Nandy has over 180 research publications in International Journals and Proceedings of International Conferences that highlight his research contributions.

  Prof. Nandy has brought in large research contracts/grants from leading industries such as Intel, Hewlett Packard, Philips Research, STMicroelectronics, Texas Instruments, Sun Microsystems, Boeing, and SAFRAN to carry out research in micro-architecture design, memory hierarchy design in CMPs and MP-SoCs, runtime reconfigurable architectures, and SoC platforms. He works closely with DRDO laboratories on projects of national interest.

  Prof. Nandy is the founder of a technology incubation company <a href="www.morphing.in">Morphing Machines, Pvt. Ltd</a>, set up in partnership with the Indian Institute of Science. He holds the position of Honorary Chief Scientist at Morphing Machines. He co-founded <a href="www.renelife.co.in">ReneLife</a>, along with Prof. Debnath Pal, under the faculty entrepreneurship programme of the institute. ReneLife is engaged in developing hardware-software co-designed accelerated solutions for next-generation sequencing for Life Sciences applications.

  Prof. Nandy is a senior member of the IEEE. He has served as a member of the Programme Committee of several IEEE International conferences, viz. ASP-DAC, HiPC, VLSI Design, DAC, SAMOS. He is a member of the faculty selection committee of the Indian Institute of Science, and other institutions in the country, and a consultant to numerous industries in the area of VLSI Design and Embedded Systems. He has been an examiner for several PhD theses from IITs, and other leading institutions within and outside the country.

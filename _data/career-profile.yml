  Prof. S. K. Nandy was instrumental in initiating research in LSI System Design at the Indian Institute of Science. He worked towards setting up a State-of-the-art laboratory for Computer Aided Design at the institute in 1983 with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme and the Government of India. This laboratory has active collaborations with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA, Technical University of Delft, The Netherlands, Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, The Netherlands, Tokyo University and Waseda University, Japan, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, and RWTH Aachen University, Germany. Today, the laboratory is engaged in state-of-the-art research in Embedded Reconfigurable System on Chip architectures for next-generation high-performance computing on the edge and core.
  
  Prof. Nandy is a Senior Professor in the Department of Computational and Data Sciences. Over the years, he has graduated 28 PhDs, 16 MSc.(Engg.) and over 100 Masterâ€™s students who have worked for their theses in the laboratory. He has another 8 PhDs in progress. His current research addresses important issues in micro-architectural and compiler optimizations for power and performance in Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs) and Runtime Reconfigurable System on Chips (MP-SoCs). All of his research target massively parallel architectures/platforms for accelerating computations for Next Generation Sequence Alignment, Numerical Linear Algebra, Real-time Face Recognition, Cognition Engines, and Molecular Dynamics. Prof. Nandy has over 180 research publications in International Journals and Proceedings of International Conferences that highlight his research contributions.

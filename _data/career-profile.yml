  Prof. S. K. Nandy was instrumental in initiating research in LSI System Design at the Indian Institute of Science. He worked towards setting up a State-of-the-art laboratory for Computer Aided Design at the institute in 1983 with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme and the Government of India. This laboratory has active collaborations with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA, Technical University of Delft, The Netherlands, Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, The Netherlands, Tokyo University and Waseda University, Japan, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden, and RWTH Aachen University, Germany. Today, the laboratory is engaged in state-of-the-art research in Embedded Reconfigurable System on Chip architectures for next-generation high-performance computing on the edge and core.
